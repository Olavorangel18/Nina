# Nina Challenge

During the technical challenge for the selection process, my initial focus was to fully grasp the problem that needed to be solved and identify the necessary tools to complete the task within the given timeframe and requirements.

To achieve this, I began by examining a mock database and studying its contents to determine the essential information that needed to be displayed and the optimal approach to achieve this. Once I identified that the task involved dealing with "Complaints", I conducted thorough research on the internet to learn from existing web application implementations that handled similar scenarios, using them as a reference for developing my solution.

After the research phase, I created a swift prototype using Figma to visualize my concepts and refine the design for an efficient and practical implementation. Once the design was finalized, I moved on to develop the code. While I encountered some challenges in mapping the state of certain components and establishing their information connections, I effectively addressed these issues by utilizing the RxJS library.

To streamline the development process, I utilized a componentization architecture that incorporated a "Complaint Page" that would receive each component and assemble them into a cohesive and functional solution. Additionally, I created models and services to minimize code clutter and simplify the development process.
